# Week 5 Lab Report 

`-i` is a command option for `grep` to ignore case:

```
$ grep -i biomed */*/*
```

```

This command ignores case and searches for "worldwide".
When we want to search all related lines, ignoring case is useful.

There is another command `-v` to search and select non-matching lines:

```
$ grep -v e biomed/rr74.txt
```

This command searches all lines in WolakSpeech_usps.txt that do not have "e", inlcuding empty lines. 
Searches for non-matching lines is also useful when we want to exclude something.

```
$ grep -vi e government/*/WolakSpeech_usps.txt

This command searches all lines in WolakSpeech_usps.txt that do not have "e" and "E" (because of command option -i igornoring case), inlcuding empty lines.

`-c` command option is for suppressing the output, and print the number of lines that is matched for each file.

```
$ grep -c have 911*/*  
```

```
911report/chapter-1.txt:68
911report/chapter-10.txt:11
911report/chapter-11.txt:55

911report/chapter-8.txt:53
911report/chapter-9.txt:53

```

This command counts the number of lines that contain "have" in each file in 911report.

```
$ grep -c police 911*/*

```

911report/chapter-7.txt:4
911report/chapter-8.txt:0
911report/chapter-9.txt:40
911report/preface.txt:0
```

This command counts the number of lines that contain "police" in each file in 911report.
This is useful when we want to count something for statistic. 

```
$ grep -cv police 911*/*
```

```
911report/chapter-1.txt:731
911report/chapter-10.txt:602
911report/chapter-11.txt:815
911report/chapter-12.txt:1536

911report/chapter-6.txt:1895
911report/chapter-7.txt:1575
911report/chapter-8.txt:1036
911report/chapter-9.txt:1845
911report/preface.txt:108
```

We also can combine two command options. This command counts the number of lines that do not contain "police" in each file in 911report.
