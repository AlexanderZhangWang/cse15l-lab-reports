## Part 2

The time I used to edit locally: 3:40. I have to edit the file locally then scp to the ieng6 server. The more files I have edited, the more file names I have to type in the `scp` command. Also, it is difficult to type the destination of where I want to `scp` to. For this example, I have to type `scp DocSearchServer.java cs15lfa22po@ieng6.ucsd.edu:week6-skill-demo1/`

The time I used to edit remotely: 00:54. I just need to type `vim DocSearchServer.java` and then edit the file. I also can use vim commands such as `/` to search around and made my editing more efficient.

> Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?

I would like to use Vim if I have to work on a program that is running remotely. Then I do not have to scp files each time I edit it.

> What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)

Some reasons that may change my decision to edit locally are when I have to make major changes and when I am able to run my code and test my code locally. (For example, I cannot run my .sh code on my window laptop).
